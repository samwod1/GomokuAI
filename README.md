Hello!

To be able to run the game please make sure you install the pygame library.

Please run 'python -m pip install -U pygame==2.3.0 --user' (without quotes) on your relevant python console, such as
the Anaconda console, windows powershell or pycharm terminal. For more information about how to install pygame please
visit: https://www.pygame.org/news

To run the program please run the 'Main.py' file which will start the game. If you wish to alter the parameters of the 
game e.g board size, win condition and AI player. Please change the values between lines 4 - 7 of 'initialise.py'.

Any questions please email sam.hunter.2019@uni.strath.ac.uk

Thanks
