when traverse and expand is called it is passed the whole state and which includes
the whole board and also who's turn it is

30/12/2022 - turns out the timeout clock for the traverse and expand stage was too short to be able
to even add any nodes to the tree, so when the next stage was looking in the tree it found nothing
producing a key error.

Now turning my efforts to optimising my program the best i can before testing and evaluating MCTS
effectiveness on the Gomoku problem, testing it and then implementing RAVE.

given enough time the monte carlo tree search method is making different moves depending on the context
which is a good sign.

02/01/22 - the branching factor is still however too large with this implementation of MCTS, I will have to use the RAVE
modification to

05/01/223 - turns are are all screwed up so need to figure that out, program isnt updating RAVE values as it cant recognise when actions are found.

Need to clarify what paper means by Children of the nodes RAVE values being updated, how do i know what one is children etc
