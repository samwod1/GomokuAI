when traverse and expand is called it is passed the whole state and which includes
the whole board and also who's turn it is

30/12/2022 - turns out the timeout clock for the traverse and expand stage was too short to be able
to even add any nodes to the tree, so when the next stage was looking in the tree it found nothing
producing a key error.

Now turning my efforts to optimising my program the best i can before testing and evaluating MCTS
effectiveness on the Gomoku problem, testing it and then implementing RAVE.

given enough time the monte carlo tree search method is making different moves depending on the context
which is a good sign

08/01/2023 - win conditions arent working for the AI code, need to get rid of check for successors in the tree, slows
the program down massively..
